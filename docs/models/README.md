## Quick Model Selection Guide

### Choose Rule-Based If:
- You need a quick baseline
- Interpretability is critical
- You have limited data
- Fast inference is required

### Choose Logistic Regression If:
- You want interpretable coefficients
- You have moderate data volumes
- You need probabilistic outputs
- Computational resources are limited

### Choose Random Forest If:
- You need good accuracy with minimal tuning
- Feature importance is valuable
- You want robust performance across circuits
- Moderate training time is acceptable

### Choose XGBoost If:
- Maximum accuracy is the priority
- You have sufficient training data (100+ races)
- Computational resources are available
- You can spend time tuning hyperparameters

### Choose LightGBM If:
- You have large datasets
- Fast training is important
- Memory is constrained
- Accuracy similar to XGBoost is acceptable

### Choose Ensemble If:
- You need the absolute best accuracy
- Training time is not critical
- You can afford slower inference
- You have resources for multiple models

## Prediction Types

All models support three prediction targets:

### 1. Podium Prediction (`target_type='podium'`)
Predict if a driver will finish in the top 3.

**Use case**: General race predictions, betting markets

### 2. Points Prediction (`target_type='points'`)
Predict if a driver will finish in the top 10 (points-scoring position).

**Use case**: Championship predictions, driver performance analysis

### 3. Win Prediction (`target_type='win'`)
Predict if a driver will win the race.

**Use case**: Winner betting, race strategy analysis

## Common Workflow

```python
from f1_predict.models.random_forest import RandomForestRacePredictor
from f1_predict.features.engineering import FeatureEngineer
from f1_predict.models.evaluation import ModelEvaluator
import pandas as pd

# 1. Load and prepare data
data = pd.read_csv('data/raw/race_results_2020_2024.csv')
engineer = FeatureEngineer()
features = engineer.create_basic_features(data)

# 2. Split data
train = features[features['season'].astype(int) < 2024]
test = features[features['season'].astype(int) == 2024]

# 3. Train model
model = RandomForestRacePredictor(target_type='podium', n_estimators=100)
model.fit(train)

# 4. Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(test)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(test)

# 5. Evaluate
evaluator = ModelEvaluator(model)
metrics = evaluator.evaluate(test, test['podium'])
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']:.1%}")

# 6. Save model
model.save('models/random_forest_podium.pkl')

# 7. Load model later
loaded_model = RandomForestRacePredictor.load('models/random_forest_podium.pkl')
```

## Feature Requirements

All ML models require engineered features. Use the `FeatureEngineer` class:

```python
from f1_predict.features.engineering import FeatureEngineer

engineer = FeatureEngineer()
features = engineer.create_basic_features(raw_data)
```

**Basic features include:**
- Driver qualification position
- Recent race performance (last 3 races)
- Constructor championship position
- Circuit-specific history
- Season progress

See [Feature Engineering Guide](../tutorials/05-feature-engineering.md) for advanced features.

## Model Training Best Practices

### 1. Data Splitting
Always use temporal split (chronological):
```python
train = data[data['season'].astype(int) < 2024]
test = data[data['season'].astype(int) == 2024]
```

❌ **Don't use random split** - creates data leakage from future to past

### 2. Cross-Validation
Use time-series cross-validation:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
for train_idx, val_idx in tscv.split(data):
    train_data = data.iloc[train_idx]
    val_data = data.iloc[val_idx]
    # Train and validate
```

### 3. Feature Scaling
Some models benefit from scaled features:
```python
# Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM: No scaling needed (tree-based)
# Logistic Regression: Scaling recommended
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train)
test_scaled = scaler.transform(test)
```

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Use grid search or random search:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [5, 10, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    model.model,  # Access underlying sklearn model
    param_grid,
    cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3),
    scoring='accuracy'
)
```

### 5. Class Imbalance
Handle imbalanced targets (e.g., wins are rare):
```python
# Option 1: Class weights
model = XGBoostPredictor(scale_pos_weight=10)  # For XGBoost

# Option 2: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

smote = SMOTE()
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```
